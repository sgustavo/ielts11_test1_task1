Dear Brian,

Hope everything is going well. To begin with, I'll let you know why to get a job and avoid a bad career choice, by going to college, is the right option.

Clearly you will not be happy in a graduation course. First, you are a creative person with interesting ideas that could make you financially succeed. A college would only hold you back, making you lose a considerable time of your life in something that for sure would not full fill your needs. 

Instead, I recommend you start to work as soon as possible. A job benefits you with the real world experience, allowing you to assess the variety type of business and to increase your wealth sooner. 

To summarize, I strongly suggest you to look for opportunities to work in advertising, insurance or promoting companies. They are highly suitable for your skills, since you are very talk-active and a spontaneous guy. 

I wish you all the best.

Yours,
Gustavo
